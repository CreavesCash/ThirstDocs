Welcome to Thirst Script
===========================

This is ThirstScript, my stupid little work-in-progress programming language.

QUICK CHANGELOG

**Version 1.0.0  27/03/2020**

Inital Lexer and Parser mostly done, statements "OUTPT", "INPUT" "IF" "THEN" "$VARIABLE"

INTRODUCTION
==============================
ThirstScript is my first attempt at creating a programming language. I am 14 years old, so manage your expectations.
I wanted to combine the ease of parsing with python, with programs like AutoHotKey.
